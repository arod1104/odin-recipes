    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Prepare the Meat Sauce</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef, onion, and
          garlic until the meat is browned and the onions are translucent. Drain
          any excess fat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.
          Add the sugar, basil, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and parsley.
          Simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and salt. Mix well.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the mozzarella and Parmesan cheese until well combined</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Cook the Lasagna Noodles:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the lasanga
          noodles in boiled water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the noodles and
          rinse with cold water. Set aside.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Assemble The lasagna:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>
          Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking
          dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place 4 lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta
          cheese mixture over the noodles. Top with 1/3 of the meat sauce.
          Repeat the layers twice more, ending with a layer of meat sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sprinkle the top with the additional mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Bake the Lasagna:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, making sure it doesn't touch
          the cheese to prevent sticking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake
          for an additional 25 minutes, or until the lasagna is hot and bubbly
          and the cheese is melted and lightly browned.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Serve:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Let the lasagna cool for about 15 minutes before serving. This will
          help the layers set and make it easier to cut and serve.
        </li>
        <li>Serve with a fresh salad and garlic bread for a complete meal.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
