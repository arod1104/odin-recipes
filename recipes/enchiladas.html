      <li>2 cups shreddded Monterey Jack or Oxaca cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of chooped onion</li>

      <li>Fresh cilantro for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the Filling:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onion and
          minced garlic, and sauté until softened.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add shredded chicken (or your choice of filling) to the skillet,
          season with salt and pepper to taste, and cook until heated through.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Warm the Tortillas:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>
          Warm the corn tortillas slightly to make them pliable. You can do this
          by microwaving them wrapped in a damp paper towel for about 30
          seconds, or by briefly heating them in a dry skillet over medium heat.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Assemble the Enchiladas:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Spread a spoonful of green salsa on each tortilla.</li>
        <li>
          Place a portion of the chicken mixture and a sprinkle of shredded
          cheese on each tortilla.
        </li>
        <li>
          Roll up the tortillas and place them seam-side down in a baking dish.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Add Sauce and Cheese</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Pour the remaining green salsa over the enchiladas in the baking dish,
          spreading it evenly.
        </li>
        <li>Top with the remaining shredded cheese.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Bake:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for
          20-25 minutes, until the enchiladas are heated through and the cheese
          is melted and bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the foil for the last 5 minutes of baking to allow the cheese
          to become golden and slightly crispy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Serve:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Remove from the oven and let the enchiladas cool for a few minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drizzle sour cream over the top and garnish with fresh chopped
          cilantro.
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot with rice and beans, if desired.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
